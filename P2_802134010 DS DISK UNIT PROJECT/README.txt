Instructions 1:
My program can be compiled using a Java compiler. 
First you will need to unzip the folder where this is found. 
After you unzip the program, Open your Java Compiler. Here click, new java project and unclick "Use default location". After that, browse for the unzipped folder and click finish. Open all the classes in your compiler. To run it you will need to choose, run as java application.

USING THE COMMAND PROMPT 

First CD to the project 
CD src
javac p2Main 
compile and run it.
you have to separate by packages since my project is consisting of a couple packages 
I suggest using instructions 1. That is easier to do.
Or just use your program to compile :)  

Project 2: Virtual Disk Continuation

In this project, we continue working with the DiskUnit that was specified for P1 and later modified for the testing sessions. This time we will work on a simple file system to reside on a disk unit. 

The following describes a scheme to represent files in a disk unit, and details about the format operation. Later, we describe a set of commands that the system needs to support.  What we are going to work with here is usually part of the tasks that are performed by an operating system’s component called “File System Component”; however, ours will be a very simple version. 

Type in your command. Type in  "help" first to see list of commands. Now work your way from there. 
When you first create a disk a folder DiskUnits will be created in src. There the disks will be saved and accessed from. 
From there you can use the set of commands to play with the disks. 

I worked with the blocks manager and the inodes manager. Most of the commands dont work since I didnt do much of the directories and files stuff and you cant save the disk. 
You will be able to create the disk. Mount and unmount the disk. Delete the disk. The other stuff isnt done 100%. You will be able to run it though and check my progress. The classes I didnt make the tester.
